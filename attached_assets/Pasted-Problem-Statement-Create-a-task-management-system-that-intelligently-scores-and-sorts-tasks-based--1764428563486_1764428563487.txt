Problem Statement 
Create a task management system that intelligently scores and sorts tasks based on multiple  factors. Your system should help users identify which tasks they should work on first.
Part 1: Backend Development (Python/Django) Estimated Time: 2 hours 
Task Model Structure 
Each task should have the following properties: 
{ "title": "Fix login bug", "due_date": "2025-11-30", "estimated_hours": 3,  "importance": 8, // 1-10 scale "dependencies": [] // list of task IDs }



The Core Challenge: Design a Priority Algorithm 
Create a scoring function that calculates task priority by considering multiple factors. Your  algorithm should intelligently weigh: 
• Urgency: How soon is the task due? Past-due tasks should be weighted  appropriately. 
• Importance: User-provided rating (1-10 scale) 
• Effort: Lower effort tasks might be "quick wins" worth prioritizing 
• Dependencies: Tasks that block other tasks should rank higher 
Required API Endpoints 
POST  
/api/tasks/analyze/
Accept a list of tasks and return them sorted by priority  score. Each task should include its calculated score.
GET /api/tasks/suggest/ 
Return the top 3 tasks the user should work on today, with  explanations for why each was chosen.



Critical Considerations 
• How do you handle tasks with due dates in the past? 
• What if a task has missing or invalid data? 
• How do you detect circular dependencies? 
• Should your algorithm be configurable? (e.g., user preferences for weighting) • How do you balance competing priorities (urgent vs important)?
Part 2: Frontend Development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) Estimated Time: 1.5 hours 
Required Interface Components 
1. Input Section 
• Form to add individual tasks with all required fields 
• Option to paste JSON array of tasks for bulk input 
• Button to "Analyze Tasks" that calls your API 
2. Output Section 
• Display sorted tasks with their calculated priority scores 
• Visual priority indicators (e.g., color coding: High/Medium/Low) • Show a brief explanation of why each task received its score • Display the task details (title, due date, effort, importance) 
3. Critical Thinking Element (Important!) 
Add a toggle or dropdown to switch between different sorting strategies: • "Fastest Wins": Prioritize low-effort tasks 
• "High Impact": Prioritize importance over everything 
• "Deadline Driven": Prioritize based on due date 
• "Smart Balance": Your custom algorithm that balances all factors Frontend Requirements 
• Functional interface that successfully communicates with your API • Clean, readable code with proper event handling 
• Basic form validation before API calls 
• Error handling and user feedback (loading states, error messages) • Responsive design (should work on different screen sizes)
